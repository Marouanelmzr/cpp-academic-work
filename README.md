# C++ Academic Exercises and Projects

## Overview
This repository contains C++ exercises and small projects completed as part of my academic coursework. It demonstrates my understanding of fundamental programming concepts, object-oriented design, data structures, and problem-solving skills.

## Highlights
- **Object-Oriented Programming:** Classes, constructors, destructors, operator overloading  
- **Data Structures:** Implementation of arrays, vectors, linked lists, stacks  
- **Problem Solving:** Small projects applying algorithms and logical thinking  

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Marouanelmzr/cpp-academic-work.git
2. Navigate to the folder containing the .cpp file
3. Compile and run using g++:
    ```bash
    g++ filename.cpp -o output
    ./output

## Notes
* All exercises are academic and for learning purposes
* Each folder contains a brief comment header explaining the exercise objectives
